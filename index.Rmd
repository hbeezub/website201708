##Sample Website for Filtering Columns & Rows

Using Dplyr, we can filter colums & rows by using "select" for specific columns & "filter" for specific rows.  Example using Lahman baseball databases.  First load Laman & Dplyr packages


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(dplyr)
```

Now suppose we would like to see the homerun total for the 1927 New York Yankees.  We could run the following code:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Batting %>%
  select (playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter (teamID=='NYA' & yearID==1927)
```


If we want to add more nuance (like my showoff friend Ron) we can qualify for over 50 home runs:

```{r}
Batting %>%
  select (playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter (teamID=='NYA' & yearID==1927 & HR > 50)
```
