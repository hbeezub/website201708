##filtering columns & rows

Using Dplyr, can filter colums & rows by using select for specific columns & filter for specific rows.  Example using Lahman baseball databases.  first load Laman & Dplyr packages


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(dplyr)
```

Now suppose we would like to see the homerun total for the 1927 New York Yankees.  We could run the following code:

```{r}
Batting %>%
  select (playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter (teamID=='NYA' & yearID==1927)
```
